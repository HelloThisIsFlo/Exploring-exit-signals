Results: 
    SIGKILL:
        Sigkill kill without any warning the targeted process.
        But kills ONLY the targeted process. No cascade !!
        Not possible to trap.
        If process has childrens, they become orphans. (And get attached to init (pid 1))

Random notes:
    Cannot kill SIGKILL PID1 on Docker. 
    But no problem kill with SIGTERM (graceful shutdown)

Note: 
    Docker`kill`vs`exec kill`:
        PID1:
            To directly send a kill signal to the process PID1 of a container
            => Use `docker kill --signal SIGXXX CONTAINER`

            For other processes 
            => Use `docker exec CONTAINER kill -X PID`

            For PID1 the difference in using `kill -signal=SIGXX` and `exec kill -SIGXX 1`
            => Can NOT send a SIGKILL to PID1 from inside the container.
            => No problems with other signals SIGINT/SIGTERM (Graceful shutdown)
        Default:
            Without arguments `docker kill` sends a SIGKILL.
            Without arguments `docker exec kill` sends a SIGTERM.
    StandardOutputOnDetachedMode:
        To view standard output on detached mode
        => Use `docker logs puzzle`
        => `-f` option to follow in real time
    PID1OnDocker:
        When the PID1 is killed, the docker container is destroyed.
        No matter if orphan processes are still there.

                It replaced `trap.sh` with `sleep.sh`

                `trap.sh` has been replaced by `sleep.sh` on the `exec` command
